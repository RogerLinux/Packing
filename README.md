This project is inteneded to solve the packing problem with allowing overlap.
Just compile Packing.c before using the app.

The app can access to files that store each circle's radius, or just randomly assign radius to each circle with given radii range, please use 'help' option for more info.

The app would export a py file for display, so be sure you have installed Python and matplotlib on your system.
